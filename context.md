### Project Overview  
A calorie-tracking mobile app built with Expo that uses AI-powered food recognition (LogMeal API) to analyze meal photos, display nutritional data, and log meals. Features include photo capture, real-time analysis, and a user-friendly interface for seamless dietary tracking.  

### Tech Stack  
- **Framework**: Expo (React Native)  
- **Language**: TypeScript  
- **Navigation**: Expo Router  
- **UI Library**: React Native Paper  
- **Backend/Auth**: Supabase (authentication, data storage)  
- **Deployment**: Expo Go  

### Feature List  

#### Expo Setup  
- **Initial Configuration**: Set up Expo project with TypeScript, Expo Router, and React Native Paper for consistent UI.  

#### Authentication Flow  
- **User Login/Signup**: Supabase-backed authentication with email/password or social logins.  

#### Photo Capture  
- **Camera Integration**: Expo’s `Camera` and `ImagePicker` both for capturing meal photos.  
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resize/optimize images before API upload.  

#### AI-Powered Food Recognition  
- **LogMeal API Integration**: Send photos to LogMeal for food identification, portion estimation, and nutritional data (calories, macros).  
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Display results immediately after processing.  

#### Nutritional Display  
- **Dynamic Breakdown**: Show macros (protein, carbs, fats) and calories per item/total.  
- **Visual Feedback**: Charts (React Native SVG) or progress bars for macros.  

#### Meal Logging  
- **Local/Supabase Storage**: Save meals with timestamps; fetch past entries.  
- **Offline Support**: Cache meals locally when offline.  

#### Error Handling  
- **User-Friendly Alerts**: Clear messages for API failures/unrecognized foods.  
- **Fallback Options**: Manual input or retry prompts.  

#### UI/UX Enhancements  
- **Loading States**: Skeletons/spinners during API calls.  
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to screen sizes (React Native Paper’s responsive utilities).  
- **Animations**: Expo Lottie for transitions/feedback.  

#### Navigation  
- **Tab-Based**: Expo Router tabs for Home (camera), History, and Profile.  
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe to delete/archive meals.  

#### Deployment  
- **Expo Go**: Test internally; EAS for production builds.  

Each feature is optimized for mobile: touch interactions, offline resilience, and minimal latency.


### More Detailed Context

app should focus on core features like photo capture, AI food recognition, nutritional display, and a user-friendly interface and meal logging and error handling for a more complete experience.

### Photo Capture and AI Integration
Your app needs to let users take meal photos using the camera, then use an AI API to analyze these images. This involves identifying food items, estimating portion sizes, and providing nutritional details like calories, protein, carbs, and fats. APIs such as [LogMeal Food AI](https://logmeal.com/api/),seem appropriate, with LogMeal explicitly supporting quantity estimation.

### Display and User Experience
After analysis, the app should display the nutritional breakdown clearly, showing both individual food items and totals. The interface must be intuitive and visually appealing, ensuring easy navigation and engagement, especially for viewing results.

### Meal Logging and Error Handling
 Meal logging to save entries with timestamps and view history, plus error handling for API failures, allowing retries or manual input if needed. These can enhance the dietary tracking experience but are not mandatory.

- **AI-Powered Food Recognition:** Implement a feature allowing users to capture meal photos, with the app using AI to analyze these images and provide accurate nutritional breakdowns, including calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fats. The technical requirement is to integrate advanced image recognition algorithms capable of identifying various food items and estimating portion sizes, with the expected outcome being immediate and precise nutritional information to enhance dietary tracking.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Design an intuitive and visually appealing interface that facilitates seamless navigation and interaction, ensuring the process of capturing photos and viewing nutritional information is straightforward and engaging, leading to high user satisfaction and engagement.

1. **Photo Capture Functionality:**
   - Users must be able to take pictures of their meals using the device's camera. This is a fundamental feature to initiate the AI analysis process, aligning with the requirement for capturing meal photos.

2. **AI Integration for Food Recognition:**
   - The app needs to integrate with an AI API capable of analyzing the captured images. Research into available APIs, such as [LogMeal Food AI](https://logmeal.com/api/),
   - Specifically, the API must identify food items, estimate portion sizes, and provide nutritional information, including calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fats. LogMeal, for instance, explicitly mentions extracting ingredients and calculating quantities, making it suitable. 

3. **Display of Nutritional Information:**
   - After analysis, the app should display the nutritional breakdown in a clear format, showing details for each recognized food item and the total values for calories, protein, carbs, and fats. This ensures users receive immediate and precise information, enhancing their dietary tracking experience.

   - The interface must be intuitive and visually appealing, with easy navigation for capturing photos and viewing results. This includes ensuring responsiveness across devices and providing engaging visual feedback, such as loading indicators during API processing, to maintain user satisfaction and engagement.

- **Meal Logging:** Allow users to save meal entries with timestamps and provide a history view for past meals and their nutritional information. This can be implemented by storing data locally or via a backend, enhancing usability for tracking over time.

- **Error Handling:** Implement graceful handling for potential issues, such as API failures or unrecognized food items. This could include displaying error messages and offering options to retry the analysis or manually enter food details, ensuring robustness.


### Functionality, User Experience, Innovation, and Code Quality
functionality, user experience, innovation, and code quality, so ensuring a well-structured, commented codebase and creative approaches (e.g., animations, error handling) will be beneficial. Given the current time (12:58 AM PDT on Friday, April 11, 2025), plan your development timeline to meet deadlines, demonstrating commitment and openness to learning as expected.

#### Conclusion
In summary, your app should include photo capture, AI-powered food recognition with APIs like LogMeal, display of nutritional information, and a user-friendly interface. Optional features like meal logging and error handling can enhance the experience. This approach ensures alignment with the assignment's objectives and evaluation criteria, providing a robust solution for AI-driven calorie tracking.
